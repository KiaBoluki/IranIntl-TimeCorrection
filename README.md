When you open the Iran International tv website you will see the tv schedule on the left but the it is set to Tehran time and if you're out of the country, you may confuse what time is the next program. This extension fixes and shows the times based on your locale.

### Note:

If you're using a VPN/Proxy to see the web page the time will be shown based on your IP so it may show wrong times.
